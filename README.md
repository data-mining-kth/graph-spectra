# Spectral Graph Clustering with K-eigenvector Algorithm

Authors: Brando Chiminelli, Tommaso Praturlon

The goal of this work is to implement a spectral graph clustering algorithm as the one described by the research of [Ng, Jordan and Weiss](http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nips01-spectral.pdf) using MATLAB. Given a graph, described as a series of edges (u,v) in a .csv file, we want to discover how many communities are present. Firstly, we work on a dataset prepared by Ron Burt. He dug out the 1966 data collected by Coleman, Katz, and Menzel on medical innovation. They collected data from physicians in four towns in Illinois, Peoria, Bloomington, Quincy, and Galesburg. Secondly, we worked on a synthetic graph to further test our implementation.
